Description of the Program:

The program is a simple clicker automation script that emulates mouse clicks at a specified delay interval. It utilizes the pynput library to control mouse events and keyboard inputs.

Upon running the program, it creates a separate thread for the mouse clicking functionality. The delay between each click can be set using the delay variable. The default button for the mouse click is set to the left button, but you can modify it by changing the button variable.

The program listens for keyboard events using the pynput library's Listener class. It defines two keyboard keys for control: the "s" key to start/stop the clicking action and the "e" key to exit the program.

When the "s" key is pressed, the program toggles between starting and stopping the mouse clicking. If the clicking is already running, it stops; otherwise, it starts. The clicking action is performed by repeatedly calling the mouse.click() method with the specified delay.

When the "e" key is pressed, the program stops the clicking action and exits gracefully by setting the running flags to False.

Overall, the program allows users to automate mouse clicking actions with customizable delay intervals. It provides a simple and convenient way to automate repetitive clicking tasks.
